ROR Labeler for the NRP
=======================

The [Research Organization Registry (ROR)](https://ror.org/) is a global, community-led registry of open
persistent identifiers for research organizations. The ROR labeler for the NRP labels nodes given a
table of nodes and their ROR IDs.  It also adds a special attribute for the OSG institutional ID.

## Attributes

- `nautilus.io/OSGInstitutionID`: The ROR ID of the institution.
- `nautilus.io/OSGInstitutionID`: The OSG ID of the institution (derived from ROR value).
